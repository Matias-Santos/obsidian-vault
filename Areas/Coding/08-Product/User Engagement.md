In this document we will address some common ways of keeping our users engaged with our product, so that they consume it on a daily basis.

## Streaks

"... and then people come back every day And the reason people come back every day is because, well, if they don't come back, that number (streak) resets to zero, and people don't want to lose their streak. It works" - says Luis Von Ahn, creator of the Duolingo app.

## Notifications

"... Now, interestingly, even after all this sophistication, it turns out our algorithm for sending notifications is pretty simple. Do you wanna know what is the best time to send people a notification? I'll tell you, 24 hours after they've used the product for the last time. Why? Because if you were free yesterday at 3pm, you are probably free at 3pm today as well." 


## Passive aggressiveness

People don't like to be judged, specially if an application that it's supposed to help your career growth tells you that you are doing a bad job at it, in a passive aggressive way.

"...if you don't use Duolingo for 7 days, we stop sending you notifications" - says Luis, and continues to explain how they poke the user to feel angry at the bird and make people come back to the app.
