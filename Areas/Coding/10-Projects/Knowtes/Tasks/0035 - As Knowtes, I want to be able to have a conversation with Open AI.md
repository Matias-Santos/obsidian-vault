- Considerations: 
	- Provide clear business solution to consume the API without bankruptcy
### 1. Set Up Open AI Integration

- **API Access**: Ensure you have access to Open AI's API. You'll need an API key and endpoint details.
- **Documentation**: Refer to Open AI's API documentation for details on endpoints, request/response formats, and rate limits.

### 2. Define User Interface

- **Chat Interface**: Create a user-friendly chat interface in your React application. This interface should allow users to type messages and view responses from Open AI.

### 3. Handle API Requests

- **API Request**: Implement a function to send user messages to Open AI and receive responses. This function should handle the API request, including setting headers and managing the response.

### 4. Stream Responses

- **Streaming Responses**: To provide a seamless user experience, implement streaming responses. This can be achieved by handling partial responses and updating the chat interface in real-time.

### 5. State Management

- **State Management**: Use React's state management (or a state management library like Redux) to manage the conversation history and current message state.

### 6. Error Handling

- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage API errors and provide feedback to users.
