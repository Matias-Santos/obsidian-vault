“Whoever you can help the most is who you sell to.” - Alex Hormozi

in this short https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GBbuVyZkox4 Alex speaks about a bussiness that sells to 3 different types of customers, or buyers, homeowners, interior-designers and homebuilders. Homebuilders only care about their price, so maybe they are not our best client. Interior-designers bring customers all the time, they bring their person that wants to see the product so we got a possible customer, and a client that is bringing them to our bussiness. Homeowners are a one time purchase, but they have the most margin on product, so we can take a best ROI. 

After all, the most profitable way of generating more profit will always be by bringing more customers, by this way we scale our hole bussiness entirely.
