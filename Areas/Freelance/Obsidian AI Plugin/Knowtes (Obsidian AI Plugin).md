## Introduction

This web app will have the objective of giving useful notes for the user, via the inclusion of Perplexity AI to generate the notes for us, by synchronizing our Obsidian's Vault from Github services.

## Objectives

- [ ] Develop frontend for web app, following markdown standards to ensure compatibility across multiple platforms.
- [ ] Integration with Perplexity services so that we can request data from its API in an ordered manner, producing some kind of components system configured by the developer so that we can paint the UI accordingly.
- [ ] Investigate Perplexity costs in order to make an auto sustainable platform.
- [ ] Provide graphs for the user so that he can take a look at patterns from the documents he has made, possible template ideas, and relational concepts between documents.
- [ ] Give the user the ability to select which documents does he want to be processed by AI or not, with selectors for "All/None" such as in email selection.
- [ ] Buy me a coffee.
