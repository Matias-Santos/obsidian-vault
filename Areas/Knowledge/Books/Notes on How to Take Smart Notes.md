## Introduction

"Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organization of writing and notetaking comes into play."

"A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless."

"We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery â€“ or insight."

Thinking is a hard process, and we need scaffolding to support our thoughts and ideas to achieve more elaborate ideas. The process of writing a thesis or a paper on some topic is not as easy as opening up a blank sheet and start writing the whole thing there. For this, we need order and discipline. Luhmann's process consists on taking short notes, focusing on trying to merge new thoughts to the already existing ones on our "slip-box", which for this context would be our [[Zettelkasten]] directory. One of the key ideas this book covers is the importance of summarizing the ideas in our head so that we can continue a train of thought from one note to another, making endless connections between them in order to help our brain to work more efficiently.
