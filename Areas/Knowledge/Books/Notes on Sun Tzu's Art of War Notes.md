## Chapter 1: Laying Plans

"26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations
in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a
battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many
calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how
much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point
that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose."
## Chapter 2: Waging War

"2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in
coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be
damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your
strength."
## Chapter 3: Attack by Strategem

"18. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself,
you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know
yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also
suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you
will succumb in every battle."

## Chapter 4: Tactical Disposition

"7. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret
recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth
from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we
have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is
complete."

"18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of
quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity;
Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of
chances."

## Chapter 5: Energy

"17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated
fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength."

## Chapter 6: Weak Points and String

"1. Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the
coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is
second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive
exhausted."

"7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only
attack places which are undefended. You can ensure the safety of
your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked."

"12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from
engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely
traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something
odd and unaccountable in his way."

"17. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his
rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van;
should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he
strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends
reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak."

"18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against
possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our
adversary to make these preparations against us."

"23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.
Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots."

"28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory,
but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of
circumstances."

"32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in
warfare there are no constant conditions."

## Chapter 7: Maneuvering

"5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an
undisciplined multitude, most dangerous."

"6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an
advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the
other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves
the sacrifice of its baggage and stores."

"7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and
make forced marches without halting day or night, covering
double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in
order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three
divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy."

"8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall
behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach
its destination."

"11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage train is
lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is
lost."

"13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are
familiar with the face of the country---its mountains and forests,
its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps."

"16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be
decided by circumstances."

"18. In raiding and plundering be like fire, in immovability like a
mountain."

"19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when
you move, fall like a thunderbolt."

"23. The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle,
the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution
of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly
enough: hence the institution of banners and flags."

"26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and
drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means
of influencing the ears and eyes of your army."

"28. Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it
has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on
returning to camp."

"30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and
hubbub amongst the enemy:---this is the art of retaining selfpossession."

"31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait
at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed
while the enemy is famished:---this is the art of husbanding one's
strength."

"32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in
perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm
and confident array:---this is the art of studying circumstances."

"36. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not
press a desperate foe too hard."

## Chapter 8: Variation in Tactics

"6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of
varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five
Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men."

"11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the
enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him;
not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that
we have made our position unassailable."

"12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general:
(1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice,
which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be
provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to
shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to
worry and trouble."

"14. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause
will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them
be a subject of meditation."

## Chapter 9: The Army on the March

"1. Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the
army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over
mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys."

"2. Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in
order to fight. So much for mountain warfare."

"4. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do
not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half
the army get across, and then deliver your attack."

"13. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side,
with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the
benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the
ground."

"23. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of
chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide
area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out
in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to
collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify
that the army is encamping."
