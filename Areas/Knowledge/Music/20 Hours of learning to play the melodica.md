### Tips for Practice

1. **Familiarize with the Layout**: Spend some time getting to know the layout of the keys on your melodica.
2. **Practice Each Chord**: Play each chord separately until you can find and play the notes quickly.
3. **Transition Between Chords**: Practice moving from one chord to another smoothly. Start slowly and then gradually increase your speed.
4. **Use Sheet Music or Tabs**: Find some 80's classic songs that use these chords and practice playing along with them.
5. **Consistent Practice**: Dedicate regular practice sessions, even if short, to build muscle memory and familiarity.

By breaking down each chord into its component notes and practicing them consistently, you'll be able to play the most common chords for classic 80's music on your melodica.
