I made this! Is the exact reason for which I started in the path of building a second brain in Obsidian, that would allow me to come back to memories or topics which I've already spoken about.

And this is the exact reason that should push us to keep learning more things in our coding life, as a carpenter makes a simple table, we build simple applications, as an electrician builds a system for a whole building, we make Singleton patterns to hold our user session's data.

The goal is to fell in love with the process, and enjoying it along the way, while handling the pressure as best as possible, like a surgeon would in a heart transplant.
