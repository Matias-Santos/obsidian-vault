We can correlate openings from chess to the different ways of building applications, and continuing with the correlation for chess pieces, for a complete analogy.

For instance as of today I know several ways of starting a React project, all of them cover almost the same background, like e4 o d4, but may be accompanied by different modifiers that cover other squares.

We can think of the pieces from the chess board as pieces of code, which cover different topics of how to build a complete application, in order to have balance, and keep our king safe, we must develop our pieces in an effective manner, making offensive moves, while keeping an eye in our base safety.
