The pomodoro technique is a simple concept which stablishes periods of 25 minutes of absolute focus, and 5 to 10 minutes of un-focus time in between, allowing us to complete a certain amount of tasks, or "tomatoes" as Uncle Bob says in his book "The Clean Coder".

The way to achieve completable tasks in 25 minutes, we would need to chunk our work into as little as possible and edible steps, that any monkey would be able to follow. 

Tasks like building a basic React Component, with unit tests included, should be doable task in a tomato, making an ordinary Note, making a User Story description, reading a chapter, watching a video on a new programming language.
