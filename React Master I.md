In this operation we will try to master the 12 React principles, in 12 different applications, in which we will cover different core aspects of the React Developert Portfolio.

### 1. **Basic Component and JSX Practice**

- **Exercise**: Create a simple React application with a `Header` and `Footer` component. Use these components in an `App` component.
- **Goal**: Understand how to create and use components and write JSX.

### 2. **Props Practice**

- **Exercise**: Build a `UserCard` component that takes `name`, `age`, and `location` as props and displays them.
- **Goal**: Learn how to pass and access props in components.

### 3. **State Management with `useState`**

- **Exercise**: Create a counter component with “Increment” and “Decrement” buttons that increase or decrease the count state.
- **Goal**: Understand how to use the `useState` hook to manage state within a functional component.

### 4. **Event Handling**

- **Exercise**: Create a form with a text input and a submit button. Display the entered text below the form when submitted.
- **Goal**: Practice handling events in React and using state to manage form data.

### 5. **Lifecycle Methods with `useEffect`**

- **Exercise**: Create a component that fetches and displays data from a public API (like JSONPlaceholder) when it mounts. Include a “Refresh” button to refetch data.
- **Goal**: Learn how to use `useEffect` for side effects like data fetching and understand the dependency array.

### 6. **Conditional Rendering**

- **Exercise**: Build a component that shows a login form if the user is not logged in and a welcome message if the user is logged in. Use a button to toggle the login state.
- **Goal**: Practice rendering different UI based on component state.

### 7. **Dynamic Lists and Keys**

- **Exercise**: Create a component that displays a list of tasks from an array. Add functionality to add new tasks and delete existing ones.
- **Goal**: Understand how to render lists in React and the importance of using keys.

### 8. **Context API and `useContext`**

- **Exercise**: Create a theme context for managing light and dark themes in your application. Implement a `ThemeProvider` and use the `useContext` hook in a `ThemedButton` component to switch themes.
- **Goal**: Learn how to use the Context API for managing global state and sharing it across components.

### 9. **Custom Hooks**

- **Exercise**: Create a custom hook `useLocalStorage` that allows you to save and retrieve data from `localStorage`. Use this hook in a component to manage a list of favorite items.
- **Goal**: Understand how to create and use custom hooks for reusable logic.

### 10. **Advanced State Management**

- **Exercise**: Build a small to-do application where each to-do item can be marked as complete, edited, or deleted. Use state to manage the list of to-dos and their individual states.
- **Goal**: Practice complex state management and understand how state flows through components.

### 11. **Effect Cleanup**

- **Exercise**: Create a component that tracks the window size and updates the state whenever the window is resized. Ensure the event listener is cleaned up correctly using the `useEffect` cleanup function.
- **Goal**: Learn how to manage side effects properly and prevent memory leaks.

### 12. **Error Handling in Components**

- **Exercise**: Create an `ErrorBoundary` component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI.
- **Goal**: Understand how to implement error boundaries and manage errors in React.

By completing these exercises, you’ll gain hands-on experience with React’s core concepts, making you more comfortable with building and maintaining React applications.
