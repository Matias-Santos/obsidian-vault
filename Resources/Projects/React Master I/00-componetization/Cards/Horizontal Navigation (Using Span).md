## Description

As a user, I want horizontal navigation using span elements, so I can easily switch between different sections without cluttering the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Navigation links should be displayed horizontally in a single row.
- The navigation should be responsive and collapse into a burger menu on smaller screens.
- Each link should have hover and active states to indicate interaction.
- Links should be accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create the navigation bar using span elements and appropriate styling.
- [ ] Implement responsive breakpoints for mobile views.
- [ ] Add accessibility features (focus states, aria-labels).
- [ ] Test the navigation on various browsers and devices.

## Notes

- Consider using a mobile-first design approach.
- Make sure to integrate the navigation with the global routing state of the app.
