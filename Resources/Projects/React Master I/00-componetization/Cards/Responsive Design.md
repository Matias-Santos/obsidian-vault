## Description

As a user, I want the entire design system to be responsive, so the application looks and functions well on all device sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

## Acceptance Criteria

- All components (e.g., buttons, forms, navigation) should adapt to different screen sizes using media queries.
- The layout should switch to a mobile-friendly design on smaller screens.
- Content should not overflow or break on smaller screens.
- Components like carousels and forms should be touch-friendly for mobile use.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement responsive design with media queries and a mobile-first approach.
- [ ] Test all components on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- [ ] Ensure that touch elements (buttons, inputs) are mobile-friendly.
- [ ] Write responsive unit and integration tests to check layout changes.

## Notes

- Use CSS grid or flexbox for layout, allowing easy responsiveness.
- Consider adding a "desktop view" toggle on mobile for users who prefer it.
