## Description

As a developer, I want to write unit tests for the design system, so I can ensure that all components function correctly and reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each component (e.g., buttons, forms, cards) should have unit tests to cover edge cases and expected behaviors.
- The tests should check for accessibility, state changes, and props functionality.
- All tests should pass on continuous integration (CI) systems before deployment.

## Tasks

- [ ] Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).
- [ ] Write unit tests for each component with at least 90% code coverage.
- [ ] Create mock data for testing different props and states.
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass on the CI/CD pipeline.

## Notes

- Focus on edge cases, such as invalid prop types or unexpected user inputs.
- Test for performance regressions in the CI pipeline.
