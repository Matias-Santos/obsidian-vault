## Description

As a user, I want to see images zooming in from right to left in a carousel, so I can experience smooth transitions between content.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The carousel should display images that zoom in and move from right to left.
- The carousel should autoplay, but allow manual controls for pausing and skipping.
- The images should be responsive and adjust to different screen sizes.
- Include left and right arrows for navigation.
- The carousel should loop infinitely.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement zoom-in effect using CSS keyframes or JavaScript.
- [ ] Add autoplay functionality with a 5-second delay between images.
- [ ] Add manual left and right navigation controls.
- [ ] Implement responsive design for various screen sizes.
- [ ] Ensure that the carousel content is accessible (keyboard and screen reader-friendly).

## Notes

- Look into libraries like `slick-carousel` or `react-spring` for smooth animations.
- Consider lazy loading for the images to improve performance.
