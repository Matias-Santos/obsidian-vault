# <taskNumber> Implement cool feature
[[link to task]]

## Overview
Short summary of task

## Investigation
- Short bullets following my thought process
  - Sub-bullets for steps related specifically to the parent bullet

### Unexpected difficult situation
- Subheadings like these throughout to keep nesting shallow

## Implementation
- Step-by-step implementation
- Throughout the note always use full `MyClass` and `myFunction` names to make searching easier

### Bug: Something isn't working
- If I encounter a bug during implementation
- This helps if you run into this again as a regression if you change things later
