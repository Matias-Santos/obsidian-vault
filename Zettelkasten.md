## Introduction

The idea of the Zettelkasten method is that (IMO) if focuses on having atomic notes with concepts explained in a manner that your brain can understand quickly and come back to a memory you already have in your brain.

This allows for the information to transform in any given time, allowing it to continue growing like slime in a labyrinth, trying to reach every single node of knowledge.

In the end, every single author writes as he pleases, so please don't force yourself to write on a formal manner from day 1, allow yourself to be consistent making it easy for yourself to take notes, which in some tome will turn into documentation for yourself to go to, that will also allow you to write professional titles or whatever you may want to write.
